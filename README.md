# FAMI

Archive My Images (FAMI) is a tool for renaming, organising and mogrify images for my personal photographic workflow. Maybe one day we will expand this to multiple usecases.

## Features

### Photo Archive

This mode simply places the images in a folder structure based on the date the image was taken.

### Upload to Google Photos

This mode simply uploads the files to google photos, and offers the ability to create an album.

### Mogrify

This mode allows you to resize, compress and add borders to images for ease of uploading to Instagram.

## Usage

- `poetry run python -m fami`
- `poetry run pytest`
